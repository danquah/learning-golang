# Introduction

## Why choose go?

Google had problems scaling their usage of Java / C++ and decided to create their own language (there are obviously better references for the history of Go out there, go find them :))

Go was created by [Robert Griesemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griesemer_(computer_programmer)), [Rob Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike), and [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson).


The main reasons for creating Go was that C++, Java and most other languages Google
where using did not properly utilize the advances in modern hardware. We where getting
more and more cpu-cores that could only by properly utilized via concurrency, but
concurrency is _hard_ and in particular if your language does not give you good
primitives for doing concurrency.

Besides language features, the tooling surrounding Go very strong. Go has fixed
standards for formatting, compilation, dependency management and a lot more. This
allows you to

## Succeeding at the course

Todd McLeod has a number of good points on how to succeed with the course. He
references a lot of good sources such as Angela Duckworth (Grit) and Malcom
Gladwell (Outliers) and James Clear (Atomic Habits). The essence is to be consistent
in learning, having a clear goal (mine is to complete the course) and keep
putting in the work (eg, studying an hour a day).
