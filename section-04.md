# Section 4 - Variables, values and type

## Idiomatic

The Go community has a strong focus on being idiomatic - from Google define:

> Using, containing, or denoting expressions that are natural to a native speaker.

The essence that even though there are a lot of different ways to do certain thing
specific patterns are preferred even dictated.

## Control flows

We have three different control flows in (c-style?) languages.

1. Sequential: Go to the next line when this line has been executed.
2. Loops: Go back to a initial line when the last line of a block is executed.
3. Conditional: Only execute the following lines if a condition is true.

## Packages

Go code is organized into packages. You always have a package, the entry-point
into a go program is the `main` function in the `main` package.

Then a lot of random tidbits - mostly to explain the following code

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	n, _ := fmt.Println("Hello, playground", 42, true)
	fmt.Println(n)
}
```

* Variadic parameters (`...`) is a variable list of parameters.
* The empty interface is like saying `any` in typescript (or maybe `unknown`?)
  it's a way to accept any type. `fmt.Println` for instance takes an unlimited
  list of empty interface instances.
* Underscore (`_`) variables are throwaway variables, use them in situations where
  you have to accept a parameter, but don't want it. This is needed as you are
  not allowed to have un-used variables (that is, except for `_`).

## Declarations, keywords etc

The most basic part of a language is its [Lexical elements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Lexical_elements).

Go has comments

```go
// I'm a comment.

/*
  So am I.
*/
```

And Tokens

1. Identifiers
2. Keywords
3. Operators
4. Punctuation

Tokens are separated by whitespace (space, tab, carrier return, newline) which
is ignored except when it separates tokens. Newlines can be generated by inserting
a semicolon in situations where you want things to be visually on the same line.

Identifies are defined like this in EBNF

```text
identifier = letter { letter | unicode_digit } .
```

Keyword are the fundamental words that makes up a programming language. They
are reserved and cannot be re-declared.

```text
break        default      func         interface    select
case         defer        go           map          struct
chan         else         goto         package      switch
const        fallthrough  if           range        type
continue     for          import       return       var
```

Operators and Punctuation

```text
+    &     +=    &=     &&    ==    !=    (    )
-    |     -=    |=     ||    <     <=    [    ]
*    ^     *=    ^=     <-    >     >=    {    }
/    <<    /=    <<=    ++    =     :=    ,    ;
%    >>    %=    >>=    --    !     ...   .    :
     &^          &^=          ~
```

I guess semicolons and, commas and things like that.

Operators performs an action given one or more operands. For instance `+` can be
used to add two numbers (acting as operands).

Statements are a combination of tokes that can be executed. Eg. a function call,
or an assignment of a variable.

Statements often involves expressions which are combinations of tokens that can
be evaluated into a value.

```go
// Expression made up of an operator and two operands.
2 + 2

// Statement
n := 2 + 2
```
