# Learning Go

Repo that backs my work in learning Go.

I've already done some professional work with Go. Given that I've been programming
professional for quite som years now and have worked in both object-oriented and
more c-like languages, I where able to jump straight into working with Go without
any structured introduction to the language.

I've now reached a point where I'd like to not just be able to force programs
to work, but actually use Go the way it is intended. Be able to work idiomatic
as they say.

The plan is to go through ["Learn How To Code: Google's Go (golang)"](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code)
and update this repo as I go along. I'll try to type out as much code as possible
and I'll write down notes on a lot of things I already know. The idea is to be
intentional about learning these things, and that includes not assuming that
I already know all I need about the simpler things.

It's a 45+ hour course pitched as being for both beginners and experienced developers,
so I'm curious whether I'm going to do the complete course from end to end, or
will skip some sections.

We'll see
